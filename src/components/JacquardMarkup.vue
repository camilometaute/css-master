        <h5>A new dimension of interaction</h5>
        <p>From the very first touch, Jacquard feels familiar. That’s because our focus has always been to embed intelligence into everyday things without compromising their original form or function. Using Jacquard Threads, micro-electronics, and intelligent software, we create textiles and materials that can understand your gestures and communicate back using light and haptic feedback. Seamlessly integrated, our technology gives products you already know and understand a new layer of connectivity and interactivity.10 As more products adopt the Jacquard platform, you’ll have new ways to interact with the things you love.</p>
