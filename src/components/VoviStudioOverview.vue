      <h3>Now, to start, what is a brand? "It's a logo" most people say, the typefaces you use, or the colours like Coca Cola Red. In fact, it's all of these things and much more.</h3>
      <p>A brand is everything that makes you, you, a collection of emotions that those around you will experience and interact with. Today, just showing up isn't enough to stand out, brands need to push further, dig deeper to connect with their audience. We work collaboratively to define an ecosystem of values and beliefs, outlining your objectives, exploring your markets, and  translating this into authentic activations and guidelines that differentiate - not just for today but tomorrow as well.</p>
